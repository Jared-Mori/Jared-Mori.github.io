            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Kongo Web Store is a Django-based web application designed to provide users with an easy-to-use platform for buying and selling goods online. It offers features for both customers and retailers, allowing users to search for products, purchase items, and create their own listings.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used: The Django framework forms the basis of this project, which integrates the webpage with an SQL database. The project uses a mix of Python and HTML.</strong> </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> One of the challenges involved in creating this project was becoming familiar with the Django framework. Beyond this, creating a dynamic webstore front that made live queries to the SQL database was probably the largest challenge we faced while working on this project.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The final iteration of this project takes the form of a semi functional webstore. Due to the scope of the project, the webpage is not integrated with actual payment services, and is not currently hosted on a webserver. However, integrating with these services would make it a fully fledged webstore.</p>
